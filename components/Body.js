    <h3>Wedding Details</h3>
    <h4>Saturday, July 21st, 2018 at 5pm</h4>
    <h4>16 Labadine St, Quincy MA</h4>
    <p>We are so excited to have a wedding party at our house! Since this isn't going to be the usual wedding shindig, we'd like to let you know what to expect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dress code is Summer BBQ Wedding! Smart, cute & casual, and most importantly, dancing shoes!</li>
      <li>We are closing our street but still won't have a lot of parking available within a block. If Lyft or carpooling is an option for you, consider it</li>
      <li>The ceremony will start at 5pm and will be a block away from the house. There will be signs so nobody gets lost</li>
      <li>Following the ceremony there will be a cocktail hour on the yard next to our house. Flat shoes or wedges may give you an advantage at winning lawn games</li>
      <li>Dinner BBQ (veggie options included) will be served at 7pm.</li>
      <li>There is no end time. Plan to party until you are physically too tired to dance any more.</li>
    </ul>
